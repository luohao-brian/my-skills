### Background

**Default: clean paper, no dot pattern.** Single `<rect>` filled with `paper`. Don't wrap the diagram in a secondary container background — the diagram sits directly on the page.

```svg
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
```

**Optional: dotted paper variant.** When a long-form editorial diagram benefits from textured ground (essays, hero diagrams on a dedicated page), opt in by adding the `dots` pattern and a second rect:

```svg
<defs>
  <pattern id="dots" width="22" height="22" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
    <circle cx="1" cy="1" r="0.9" fill="rgba(45,49,66,0.10)"/>
  </pattern>
</defs>
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
<rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#dots)" opacity="0.6"/>
```

Don't use the dot pattern when the diagram sits inside a product page, slide, or card — the texture compounds with surrounding chrome and reads as noise.
