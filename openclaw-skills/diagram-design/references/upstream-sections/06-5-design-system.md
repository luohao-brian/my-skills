## 5. Design System

**The design system is skinnable.** [`references/style-guide.md`](../../upstream/references/style-guide.md) is the single source of truth for colors, typography, tokens, and the default palette; this file names semantic roles (`paper`, `ink`, `muted`, `accent`, `link`, …). To apply a brand, edit `style-guide.md` or run the URL-based flow in [`references/onboarding.md`](../../upstream/references/onboarding.md).

> When specs below or in type references mention "ink", "accent", "muted", etc., look up the current hex value in `style-guide.md`.

Type-reference snippets write roles as placeholders: `{ink}`, `{ink @ 0.40}` for a role at an opacity, and `{node-name}`, `{sublabel}`, `{eyebrow}`, `{arrow-label}`, `{title}`, `{callout}` for fonts. Resolve every placeholder against `style-guide.md` before emitting.
