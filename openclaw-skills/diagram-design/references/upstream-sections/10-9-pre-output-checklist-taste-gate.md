## 9. Pre-Output Checklist (Taste Gate)

Run before producing any diagram.

**Type fit:**

- [ ] If behavior matters, did I choose one semantic pattern before the visual type and load `semantic-patterns.md`?
- [ ] Right visual type for the layout? (§3 visual-type guide)
- [ ] Stated type, pattern, size preset, and planned cuts before drawing — confirmed, or assumptions noted? (§3)
- [ ] Would a table / paragraph do the same job? (If yes — don't draw.)
- [ ] Loaded the matching type reference linked in the visual-type guide?
- [ ] If this is an import — format, size, detail level, and audience set? `viewBox` and type ramp match the size preset? (§11, [output-spec.md §6](../../upstream/references/output-spec.md))
- [ ] If this is an import — fidelity ledger ready to report? (§11)

**Remove test:**

- [ ] Can I remove any node? (Would a reader still understand?)
- [ ] Can I merge any two nodes? (Do they always travel together?)
- [ ] Can I remove any arrow? (Is the relationship obvious from layout?)
- [ ] Can I remove any label? (Does color or shape already signal it?)

**Signal:**

- [ ] Coral used on ≤2 elements? If more, which actually deserve focal status?
- [ ] Legend covers every type used — and nothing extra?
- [ ] Within the type's complexity budget (§7)?

**Technical:**

- [ ] Diagram `<svg>` has `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` resolving to its `<title>` and `<desc>`?
- [ ] `<title>` is the first child of `<svg>` (before `<defs>`) and both `<title>` and `<desc>` are filled in?
- [ ] `<title>` / `<desc>` IDs are prefixed for this diagram and variant — never bare `title` / `desc`?
- [ ] Arrows drawn before boxes?
- [ ] **§6 rule 1:** off-axis connectors are `r=8` elbows, no diagonal slants?
- [ ] **§6 rule 2:** a visible 6 to 10px gap between every label mask and its connector?
- [ ] **§6 rule 3:** no overlapping or stacked connectors; bridge/hop at crossings?
- [ ] **§6 rule 4:** a distinct attach point per connector on a shared edge, 12px or more apart, none hiding another?
- [ ] **§6 rule 5:** no transit behind a non-endpoint box, except the unavoidable case (dashed, label at the visible end)?
- [ ] **§6 rule 6:** no label mask overlapping a node drawn after it? (From a repository checkout, run `python3 <repo-root>/scripts/verify-geometry.py <file>`.)
- [ ] Every arrow label has an opaque `fill="#f5f5f5"` rect behind it?
- [ ] Legend is a horizontal bottom strip, not floating?
- [ ] No vertical `writing-mode` text?
- [ ] `viewBox` expanded for the legend strip (~60px)?
- [ ] **`min-width` equals the viewBox width, and the SVG sits in a local `overflow-x: auto` wrapper? (Otherwise a phone scrolls the whole page — or an `overflow: hidden` ancestor clips the diagram with no scrollbar at all. See [output-spec.md](../../upstream/references/output-spec.md).)**
- [ ] Node origins, dimensions, gaps, padding on the 4px grid; type sizes on the role ramp?
- [ ] From the installed skill directory, did `python3 scripts/self_check.py <file>` pass? (Accessible-SVG contract, single-file safety, motion basics.)
- [ ] If animated, does the complete static/no-JS frame work, does reduced motion hide/disable playback, and is the controller copied verbatim from `assets/template-motion.html`? From a repository checkout, also run `python3 <repo-root>/scripts/verify-motion.py path/to/generated.html` plus the skin linter; from an installed skill, manually check print and static-query states on top of the self-check.

**Typography:**

- [ ] Brand match uses exact public families/weights, verified via `getComputedStyle`; fallbacks disclosed?
- [ ] Human-readable names in Geist sans, not Geist Mono?
- [ ] Technical sublabels (ports, commands, URLs) in Geist Mono?
- [ ] Page title in Instrument Serif?
- [ ] Annotation callouts (if any) in *italic* Instrument Serif? (see [primitive-annotation.md](../../upstream/references/primitive-annotation.md))
- [ ] No JetBrains Mono anywhere?
