### Accessible SVG contract

Every diagram is an accessible figure by default (long form: [primitives-core.md § Accessible SVG contract](../../upstream/references/primitives-core.md#accessible-svg-contract)):

1. `<svg>` carries `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` naming its `<title>` and `<desc>`.
2. `<title>` is the first child of `<svg>`, before `<defs>`.
3. IDs are `<slug>-title` / `<slug>-desc`, the slug matching the file (`loop`, `loop-dark`, `loop-full`); never bare `title` / `desc`.
4. `<title>` is the subject's short name, roughly the page `<h1>`, 60 characters or fewer.
5. `<desc>` is one sentence about the content, not the geometry.
6. Decorative-only SVG, such as the glyphs in `assets/icons.html`, carries `aria-hidden="true"` instead.
