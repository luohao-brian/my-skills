### Accessible SVG contract

Every diagram is an accessible figure by default:

1. Its `<svg>` carries `role="img"` and `aria-labelledby` naming the diagram's `<title>` and `<desc>`.
2. `<title>` is the first child of `<svg>`, before `<defs>`. Assistive technology may ignore a title placed later.
3. The IDs are prefixed per diagram and variant: `<slug>-title` / `<slug>-desc`, where the slug matches the file (`loop`, `loop-dark`, `loop-full`). Bare `title` / `desc` IDs are banned because two inline diagrams would create duplicate IDs and the second could be announced with the first diagram's name.
4. `<title>` is the short name of the subject — roughly the page `<h1>`, and about 60 characters or fewer.
5. `<desc>` is one sentence stating what the diagram shows in terms a reader needs without the image. Describe the content, not the geometry: “Org chart showing a command center routing work to specialist agents and escalation owners,” not “A box at the top with five boxes below it.” A shape-by-shape narration is worse than no useful description.
6. Decorative-only SVG, such as the specimen glyphs in `assets/icons.html`, carries `aria-hidden="true"` instead. Giving decorative marks accessible names adds noise.
