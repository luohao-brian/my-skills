### Arrow labels — always mask, always with margin

Every arrow label needs an opaque rect behind it. Without one it bleeds through the line. **And the label must sit with a visible gap above the connector — never on top of it.**

```svg
<!-- Mask sits 14px above the arrow (8px text height + 6px gap). Stroke is at ARROW_Y. -->
<rect x="MID_X-18" y="ARROW_Y-20" width="36" height="12" rx="2" fill="#f5f5f5"/>
<text x="MID_X" y="ARROW_Y-11" fill="#7a8399" font-size="8"
      font-family="'Geist Mono', monospace" text-anchor="middle" letter-spacing="0.06em">WRITE</text>
```

Rules:

- ≤14 characters, all-caps, centered on segment midpoint.
- **Mandatory 6–10px gap** between the bottom of the mask rect and the arrow stroke. The connector must remain visible — a label that hides its own arrow is a hard fail.
- Never `writing-mode` vertical.
- For vertical segments, place the label to the side (not on the line) with the same 6–10px horizontal gap.
